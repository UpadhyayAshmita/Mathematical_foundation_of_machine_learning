    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy jupyterlab scikit-learn scipy matplotlib tensorflow pandas\n",

    "\n",

    "This creates a file `mfml-env.yml` with all the details of your environment.\n",

    "- **JupyterLab**: Once JupyterLab is installed, you can run it using the command `jupyter lab`. It will open in your default web browser.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: Make sure your system meets the requirements for TensorFlow, especially if you are planning to use GPU acceleration.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: The correct spelling is `matplotlib` (not `matplotlab`). The above command takes this into account.\n",
    "- **Conda vs. pip**: While you're using pip here as per the task, remember that Conda can also directly install many of these packages, and sometimes it's beneficial to use Conda for certain complex packages, especially those that require specific binary dependencies.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1.2 Task 2: Simple Data Analysis Tool\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Create a Python script that performs basic data analysis on a list of numbers. The script should:\n",
    "1. Read numbers from a file.\n",
    "2. Perform analysis to find the maximum, minimum, average, and range.\n",
    "3. Identify if there are any repeated numbers and count them.\n",
    "4. Print the results in a formatted manner.\n",
    "### Steps to Follow\n",
    "1. Generate a Data File Using the package `random`:\n",
    "    - Import the package\n",
    "    - Use the function `open()` to open a file named `lab1/data.txt` in the write mode. Make sure the folder `lab1` is created\n",
    "    - Write a `for-loop` for 200 iterations\n",
    "    - In each iteration, use `random.randint(-2000, 2000)` to generate a random number within the range of [-2000, 2000], and append `'\\n'` to ensure each number is placed on a separate line.\n",
    "2. Read Data from File:\n",
    "   - Use `open()` to read from `data.txt`\n",
    "   - Convert the string of numbers into a list of integers\n",
    "3. Data Analysis:\n",
    "   - Find the maximum and minimum values using `max()` and `min()`\n",
    "   - Calculate the average (mean) of the numbers\n",
    "   - Determine the range (max - min) of the numbers\n",
    "   - Use `abs()` to report the absolute value of the largest negative number (if any)\n",
    "   - Identify if there are repeated numbers and count them using `dict()`\n",
    "4. Display Results:\n",
    "   - Use `print()` to display results\n",
    "   - Format the output to be user-friendly\n",
    "5. Additional Challenge (Optional):\n",
    "   - Use `enumerate()` in any part of your code where it might be useful\n",
    "   - Implement error handling for file reading and data conversion"
