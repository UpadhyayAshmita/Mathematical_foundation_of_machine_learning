### Labs
We will be using the labs to explore the various aspects of the machine learning including the data, python, git, and some useful python libraries. We will go through the [Lab 1](lab1.ipynb) next Monday (01-29-24).
- [Lab 0](lab0.md): Setting the Stage
- [Lab 1](lab1.ipynb): Data Preporcessing
- [Lab 2](lab2.ipynb):

### Tips
In Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you can also access and use a terminal directly within the interface. This integrated terminal provides a convenient way to perform shell commands, manage Conda environments, or run scripts without leaving the Jupyter environment. To access the terminal in JupyterLab, simply click on the 'Terminal' option in the Launcher window or go to 'File' > 'New' > 'Terminal' from the menu bar. In Jupyter Notebook, the process may vary slightly depending on the version and the platform, but typically, you can access it from the 'New' dropdown menu in the Jupyter Dashboard. This integrated terminal behaves just like a standard command-line interface, allowing you to seamlessly switch between coding in Jupyter and performing command-line tasks.
