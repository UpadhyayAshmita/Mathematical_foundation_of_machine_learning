## Final Project

**NOTE**: Only select one of the following projects to be your final project. Or, you can do your own project, but you must get approval from the instructor first.<br>
The final project should be turned in as a Jupyter notebook. It should be well-documented and organized. It should be clear how to run the code and what the code does. The code should be well-written and efficient. The project should be your own work. You can discuss the project with others, but the code and write-up should be your own work. You should cite any sources you use. You should also include a list of references at the end of the project. The project should be turned in on your GitLab repository. The project is due on the last day of class. 
The penality of late projects is 10% per day.

### Project 1
There are 29 datasets generated from real applications. Choose one dataset as the target traing/test set and use the methods covered in this semster to study the dataset.

### Project 2 
There are some topics that we don't cover in this semester. You can choose one of the following topics and do a project on it. 
The requirement of this project is a little bit different since you don't work on a dataset specifically. 
You need to write a short report and code to explain the topic. The topic includes:
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Boltzmann Machines
4. ResNet
5. Graph Attention Networks (GATs) 
6. Transformer
7. Reinfocement Learning
